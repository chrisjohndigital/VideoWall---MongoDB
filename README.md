VideoWall - MongoDB
======================================

Lightweight Node.js and MongoDB application for creating asynchronous HTML5-video based collaborative learning spaces

##About

Interested in developing HTML5-video based asynchronous collaborative learning spaces, interested in building sign language learning applications, VideoWall will get you started using Node.js and MongoDB

##Lightweight

I have deliberately tried to keep the application as bare bones as possible to allow rapid development, views are pretty basic and there is very little CSS/JavaScript but I have added a light Bootstrap touch for styling

##Platform

[mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/)
